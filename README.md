# Forest Fire Prediction
This is a machine learning project which aims at predicting whether a forest fire will occur on the basis of the Humidity, Temperature and Oxygen Levels of a forest. It uses logistic regression to perform a binary classification task. It classifies the forests into 0 (a forest fire will not occur) and 1 (a forest is likely to uccur).
